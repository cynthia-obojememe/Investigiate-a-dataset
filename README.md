# Investigiate-a-dataset
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. I analyized and communicated my findings on the  various factor that determines if a patient shows up for the appointment or not using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn
